\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	This paper details the development of SwingGame, a 2D video game in which players use ropes and grappling hooks to get to a goal in various levels.  The SwingGame project had two main goals, to produce a reusable framework for building games and to produce a fun and engaging game using that framework. The goals were successfully achieved with the framework being used for multiple finished products and SwingGame receiving praise by those who have seen and played it.
